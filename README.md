## Basics

Please **do not** push onto the master branch.

Create a branch for each functionnality you want to implement.

`git checkout -b newBranchName`

Document your commits properly.

`git commit -m "Your nice description of the commit"`

Only push when you're satisfied with your work.

`git push`

If you have made any unwanted push just tell me, I'll sort it out.

I'll merge when needed.
